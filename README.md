# Masakhane Weekly Meeting Agenda
An experiment at formulating our meetings in an open source and more democratic manner

Each week, Masakhane holds a community meeting. They've taken various forms, and we're evolving them as we go. One thing that is becoming obvious is that, in order to scale, we're going to need to come up with a way to formulate our meeting discussions in an agile and democratic way.

Inspired by [Awesome Reading Group](https://github.com/hadyelsahar/awesome-reading-group) which is an agile reading group format, let's try experiment with a weekly meeting agenda.

## How it could work?

1. ADD and VOTE on topics as comments in the voting issue. Please stick to a heading, and why you think it's important to discuss

2. The top voted comments from "voting issue" gets selected for the next meetin agenda. The corresponding comment gets deleted from the voting issue and a new issue is created with the date of the meeting discussion, featuring the top comments. 

3. The meeting happens, and meeting summaries are posted on the issue for that meeting

# Masakhane Weekly Meeting Agenda
An experiment at formulating our meetings in an open source and more democratic manner

Each week, Masakhane holds a community meeting. They've taken various forms, and we're evolving them as we go. One thing that is becoming obvious is that, in order to scale, we're going to need to come up with a way to formulate our meeting discussions in an agile and democratic way.

Inspired by [Awesome Reading Group](https://github.com/hadyelsahar/awesome-reading-group) which is an agile reading group format, let's try experiment with a weekly meeting agenda.

## How it could work?

An issue is created each week for the topics to be discussed in the weekly meeting
Each week, members are asked to:
1. Add meeting items to the issue that they think are relevant
2. Vote and label each item in the comments as follows: 
  - :thumbsup: - to be discussed this week
  - :soon: - not this week, but let's discuss soon

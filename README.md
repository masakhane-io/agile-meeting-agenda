# Masakhane Weekly Meeting Agenda
An experiment at formulating our meetings in an open source and more democratic manner

Each week, Masakhane holds a community meeting. They've taken various forms, and we're evolving them as we go. One thing that is becoming obvious is that, in order to scale, we're going to need to come up with a way to formulate our meeting discussions in an agile and democratic way.

Inspired by [Awesome Reading Group](https://github.com/hadyelsahar/awesome-reading-group) which is an agile reading group format, let's try experiment with a weekly meeting agenda.

Our Masakhane meetings take the following format (this has emerged over time)
1. An overall "state-of-play" update of the whole initiative (this is aimed at newcomers or people who have missed sessions)
2. Initiative updates from our on-going or upcoming initiatives. Here they can request help on specific tasks
3. Any big questions that need discussion
4. Open Floor. This includes requests for help for newcomers, and pairing up to mentors, follow ups on small todos.

The **BIG QUESTIONS** at point #3 are currently decided at random and it's hard to focus what big questions we should be handling. That's where we'd like this weekly meeting agenda to assist 

## How it could work?

1. ADD and VOTE on topics as comments in the [voting issue](https://github.com/masakhane-io/agile-meeting-agenda/issues/1). Please stick to a heading, and why you think it's important to discuss

2. The top from "voting issue" gets selected as the BIG TOPIC the next meeting agenda. The corresponding comment gets deleted from the voting issue and a new issue is created with the date of the meeting discussion, featuring the top comments. 

3. The meeting happens, and meeting summaries are posted on the issue for that meeting
